Since our example controllers as well as supervisor use strings, let's describe how to send it.</p> <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute\u2013value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). In short, it is very similar to the <code>dict</code> data structure that Python uses. Starting from version 3.0, Python contains a built-in library called json. It offers encoding Python's dictionaries into JSON string and later decoding it back to a dictionary. This is very useful in our case because by reading the keys the receiver already knows what the value means.</p> <p>Let's create a simple message that we would like to send:</p> <pre><code>data = {\"robot_id\": 1, \"my_array\": [1, 1.0, 2]}\n</code></pre> <p>Before sending the data, we must convert it to the string so the emitter is able to encode it. As mentioned above, <code>json</code> library contains a method <code>dumps</code> that takes care of that.</p> <pre><code>packet = json.dumps(data)\n</code></pre> <p>The only thing we need to do is emit the packet by the Emitter. It is as easy as just calling </p> <pre><code>self.team_emitter.send(packet)\n</code></pre> <p>and the message is succesfully sent to the channel.</p>"},{"location":"communication_between_robots/#receiving-a-message","title":"Receiving a message","text":"<p>When a Receiver receives a message, it adds it to the queue.

The <code>nextPacket()</code> method is used to move the pointer to the next packet in the queue, so next time we are calling <code>getString()</code>, we are going to read next packet in the queue.</p> <p>Okay, now we have packet. How do we decode it? Well, remember our cool <code>json</code> library? We are going to use it for decoding the packet, too.</p> <pre><code>data = json.loads(packet)\n</code></pre> <p>The variable <code>data</code> now contains the same dictionary we sent by the emitter and can be accessed as normal dictionary object.</p> <p>WARNING: There are 3 robots within the team running asynchronously. If all of them are sending messages, it is always good to empty the queue before moving on, otherwise the queue might grow and you will be reading old messages. You can use a <code>while</code> loop for example</p> <pre><code>while self.team_receiver.getQueueLength() &gt; 0:\n    packet = self.team_receiver.getString()\n    self.team_receiver.nextPacket()\n    # Do something with the packet\n</code></pre> <p>WARNING: Webots does not guarantee the order of messages.
